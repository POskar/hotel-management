# Hotel Management System

Welcome to my Hotel Management System GitHub repository! This project is built using Next.js, React, Sanity.io, Tailwind CSS, and Stripe. It offers a comprehensive solution for managing hotel rooms, booking accommodations, handling payments, and providing a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication using Auth.JS.
- **Search**: Easily search for rooms by type or name.
- **Room Booking**: Seamless booking process with Stripe integration.
- **Room Reviews**: Allow guests to leave reviews for rooms.
- **Hotel Room Management**: CRUD operations for managing hotel rooms powered by Sanity.io.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark mode using React Context.

## About

This project is based on a Full Stack Tutorial from the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. However, after completing the tutorial, I decided to further enhance and optimize the application. As a result, I now have a fully functional hotel management website that offers an improved user experience and additional features.

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up environment variables for Stripe and Sanity.io.
4. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
